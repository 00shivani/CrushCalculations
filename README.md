# CrushCalculations.com 
### An interactive, fun web app for users to answer their love questions!

## Description

For project one, I used HTML, Foundation framework for CSS, and JavaScript to implement two server-side APIs to create a fun, interactive web app that provides users with answers to their love questions. On the left side of the page is a love calculator API in which users enter two names and click the "calculate" button to generate a compatibility percentage! On the right side of the page is an Urban Dictionary API in which users should enter their crush's name (or any word for that matter), and receive three Urban Dictionary definitions which can be accessed by an HTML carousel. 

The web design was inspired by 80s retrowave, and features an artistic header with a striped background done through Foundation CSS. I included floating heart emojis to add dynamism and excitement to the webpage. It is responsive to several screen sizes and follows best practices and quality file structure.
